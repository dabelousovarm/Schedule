Schedule for driving school

The main idea of the project is to create a schedule for a driving school with an administrative mode. The administrator will be able to change the schedule (changing the time of lectures and practical classes, the distribution of instructors and lecturers). The student will be able to choose the time of classes available to him and the instructors he likes.
